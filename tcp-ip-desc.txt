TCP/IP, standing for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is the communication language of the internet. It's a set of rules that allows computers to talk to each other and share information. Imagine it like a post office system for data:

IP (Internet Protocol): This is the addressing system. It assigns unique addresses to each device on the network, like a street address for your computer.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): This is the delivery system. It breaks down information into packets, sends them through the network, and ensures they arrive in the correct order and without errors.
Together, TCP and IP work behind the scenes to make sure your internet experience is smooth and seamless. Whether you're browsing websites, streaming videos, or sending emails, TCP/IP is making it all happen.
